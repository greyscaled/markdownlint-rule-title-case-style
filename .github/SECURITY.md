# Security policy

## Supported versions

Right now we're not at version 0. We are committed to security fixes as soon as
possible, but we cannot commit to backwards compatibility. Thus, please always
use the **latest** `v0.y.z` version.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Submit a new issue, with the title `Security:`. We will get back as soon as we
can.

If there's a security vulnerability that cannot be disclosed publically, then
email <greyscaled@gmail.com>.
